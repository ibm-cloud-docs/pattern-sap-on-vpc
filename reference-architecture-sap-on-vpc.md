## Architecture diagram
{: #architecture-diagram}

Figure 1 Provides a high-level summary of the pattern, an SAP Single-zone, multi-region deployment on IBM Cloud VPC.

The Primary Region supports Production workloads on VPC running on either SAP Certified Bare Metal or VSIs.
The Secondary Region supports non-Production and Disaster Recovery workloads should the customer have DR requirements.
The components deployed to the Edge VPC provide security functions and resource isolation to the IBM Cloud workloads.

Figure 1

1.  Client network connectivity is accomplished through Direct Link with VPN access for MSPs.

2.  An Edge VPC is deployed which contains routing and security functions.

3.  Transit Gateway to the Workload VPC hosting the SAP application and database(s).

4.  Public connectivity also routes through Cloud Internet Services (CIS) which can provide load balancing, failover, and DDoS services, then routes to the edge VPC

5.  Global Transit Gateway connecting the Workload VPC across regions to facilitate replication for DR purposes.


Figure 2 illustrates a more detailed network and component architecture for a single-zone, multi-region deployment to facilitate disaster recovery.

Figure 2

1.  Two separate IBM Cloud regions, one containing production, the other containing both non-production and DR.

2.  Client network connectivity is accomplished through Direct Links to each region with VPN access for managed service providers.

3.  An Edge VPC is deployed which contains routing and security functions. For security purposes, all ingress and egress traffic will route through the Edge VPC. It contains an sFTP server, Bastion host (jump), Firewalls providing advanced security functions and the SAP router and Web Dispatcher.

4.  The Edge VPC is connected to the workload VPC through a local Transit Gateway.

5.  Public connectivity routes through Cloud Internet services which can provide load balancing, failover, and DDoS services, then routes to the edge VPC

6.  The VPC APP subnet, contains SAP components hosted on redundant SAP certified VSIs or Bare metal using either local storage (BM) or shared block storage in an [SAP Scale-out](/docs/sap?topic=sap-refarch-hana-scaleout#network-layout-for-scale-out-configurations-2) environment.

7.  The VPC DB subnet hosts the SAP database, in this case HANA hosted on SAP certified VSIs or Bare metal using either local storage (BM) or block storage.

8.  Virtual Private endpoints are used to provide connectivity to cloud native services from each VPC

9.  Global Transit Gateway connecting the core/workload VPC across regions for data replication purposes between the two regions.

10. Multiple instances of redundant VSIs or BMs are used to provide 99.95% availability within a zone

## Design scope
{: #design-scope}

Following the [Architecture Framework](/docs/architecture-framework?topic=architecture-framework-taxonomy), SAP on VPC covers design considerations and architecture decisions for the following aspects and domains:

-   **Compute:** Bare Metal and Virtual infrastructure

-   **Storage:** Primary, Backup, Archive and Migration

-   **Networking:** Enterprise Connectivity, Edge Gateways, Segmentation and Isolation, Cloud Native Connectivity and Load Balancing

-   **Security:** Data, Identity and Access Management, Infrastructure and Endpoint, Threat Detection and Response

-   **Resiliency:** Backup and Restore, Disaster Recovery, High Availability

-   **Service Management:** Monitoring, Logging, Alerting, Management/Orchestration

The Architecture Framework, described in [Introduction to the Architecture Framework](/docs/architecture-framework?topic=architecture-framework-intro), provides a consistent approach to design cloud solutions by addressing requirements across a pre-defined set of aspects and domains, which are technology-agnostic architectural areas that need to be considered for any enterprise solution. It can be used as a guide to make the necessary design and component choices to ensure you have considered applicable requirements for each aspect and domain. After you have identified the applicable requirements and domains that are in scope, you can evaluate and select the best fit for purpose components for your enterprise cloud solution.

The Figure 3 shows the domains that are covered in this solution.

## Requirements
{: #requirements}

The following represents a baseline set of requirements which we believe are applicable to most clients and critical to successful SAP deployment.
